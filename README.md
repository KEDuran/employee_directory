## Description

For this assignment, students were tasked with creating a employee directory web application with React. In using React, this web application was designed creating UI components, managing component state, and able to respond to user events.

In additional to using React, I took the opporunity to incorporate _unit testing_ for certain functionality used to develop this application. Please reference the _Testing_ section in this readme.
